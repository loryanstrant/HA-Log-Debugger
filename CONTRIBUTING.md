## Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use type hints
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Home Assistant Specific

- Follow [Home Assistant development guidelines](https://developers.home-assistant.io/)
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Handle exceptions appropriately
- Log at appropriate levels (debug, info, warning, error)

### Example Code Structure

```python
"""Module description."""
from __future__ import annotations

import logging
from typing import Any

from homeassistant.core import HomeAssistant

_LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)


async def async_example_function(hass: HomeAssistant, data: dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """
    Do something asynchronously.
    
    Args:
        hass: Home Assistant instance
        data: Input data dictionary
        
    Returns:
        True if successful, False otherwise
    """
    try:
        # Implementation
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        _LOGGER.error("Error in example function: %s", e, exc_info=True)
        return False
```

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Test the integration loads correctly
2. Test configuration flow
3. Test all services work as expected
4. Verify sensors update properly
5. Check log parsing accuracy
6. Test AI analysis (if applicable)
7. Ensure no errors in Home Assistant logs

## Documentation

- Update README.md if adding features
- Update CHANGELOG.md following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update services.yaml for new services
- Update strings.json for UI text

## Git Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable

Examples:
- `Add support for custom log file paths`
- `Fix entity ID extraction for hyphenated names`
- `Update documentation for AI configuration`
- `Refactor log parsing to improve performance`
